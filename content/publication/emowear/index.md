abstract: Voice messages, by nature, prevent users from gauging the emotional tone
  without fully diving into the audio content. This hinders the shared emotional experience
  at the pre-retrieval stage. Research scarcely explored “Emotional Teasers”—pre-retrieval
  cues offering a glimpse into an awaiting message’s emotional tone without disclosing
  its content. We introduce EmoWear, a smartwatch voice messaging system enabling
  users to apply 30 animation teasers on message bubbles to reflect emotions. EmoWear
  eases senders’ choice by prioritizing emotions based on semantic and acoustic processing.
  EmoWear was evaluated in comparison with a mirroring system using color-coded message
  bubbles as emotional cues (N=24). Results showed EmoWear significantly enhanced
  emotional communication experience in both receiving and sending messages. The animated
  teasers were considered intuitive and valued for diverse expressions. Desirable
  interaction qualities and practical implications are distilled for future design.
  We thereby contribute both a novel system and empirical knowledge concerning emotional
  teasers for voice messaging.
