abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects
  how children communicate and relate to other people and the world around them. Emerging
  studies have shown that neurofeedback training (NFT) games are an effective and
  playful intervention to enhance social and attentional capabilities for autistic
  children. However, NFT is primarily available in a clinical setting that is hard
  to scale. Also, the intervention demands deliberately-designed gamified feedback
  with fun and enjoyment, where little knowledge has been acquired in the HCI community.
  Through a ten-month iterative design process with four domain experts, we developed
  Eggly, a mobile NFT game based on a consumer-grade EEG headband and a tablet. Eggly
  uses novel augmented reality (AR) techniques to offer engagement and personalization,
  enhancing their training experience. We conducted two field studies (a single-session
  study and a three-week multi-session study) with a total of five autistic children
  to assess Eggly in practice at a special education center. Both quantitative and
  qualitative results indicate the effectiveness of the approach as well as contribute
  to the design knowledge of creating mobile AR NFT games.
